## Description
    After utilizing web-based resources and instructional support, I learned how to create my own server-side APIs using the Express.js framework. First, I set up GET routes in "server.js," to send the "index.html" and "notes.html" pages to the browser. Next, I set up a GET route in "notes.js" and exported the module, to show the existing note(s). Then, I set up a POST route in "notes.js" and exported the module, to add and save new note(s). Next, because of uuid, each note is assigned a unique id. This allows the user to click a previously saved note and that particular note is rendered in the right-hand column. Last, I set up a DELETE route in "notes.js" and exported the module, to delete an existing note. Moreover, the NoteTaker allows the user to write, save, and delete notes, thereby enhancing the user's organizational skills. 

## Installation
    Run npm install in the terminal. Run npm i uuid in the terminal.
    
## Usage
    Run node server.js in the terminal.
